# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this code is to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. We wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a user-friendly website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML was used to modify the visuals of the website.

## Results
By typing in the suggested search elements as the filters, the result returns the specific matches for the search. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter. For resetting the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website or off the page.

## Summary
One drawback to this webpage is the user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as easy to understand. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "elcajon", “el cajon_”, or "El Cajon". The only acceptable input would be "el cajon".

A recommendation could be adding a trim function to catch spaces at the end of words as well as allowing for upper case letters. Another recommendation could be adding a filter on the date range rather than a singular date. Typing 1/2010 did not bring up all the dates from January as hoped. Perhaps, the UFO Sightings occur more frequently in a specific month instead of a specific day within the month.
